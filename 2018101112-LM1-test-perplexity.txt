however this polymerization is ionic chain polymerization gives us opportunity to synthesize specialized polymers like block copolymers or tellically polymers which are basically type polymers having functional groups at the end of the chain which we can we utilized for the for another reactions > 	-293.95216831568433
so let us start the discussion on ionic polymerization and let us talk about first the general characteristics > 	-107.94669588222557
and while talking these general characteristics of ionic polymerization we will compare its differences or its likeliness with the chain radical chain polymerization > 	-123.38483378471055
first is that as i just said that it is it is much more selective much more selective > 	-124.39944860573257
now why do we started our discussion on chain polymerization > 	-58.97003362652458

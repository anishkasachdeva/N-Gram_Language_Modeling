< < < similarly if you use very high polar solvents like hydroxylated solvents or ketone then the reaction actually gets stopped by reaction of these solvent molecules with the reactive species >	124707.60598283305
< < < now it we have given examples of cation and anion here where the propagating species is b plus is said the both cationic polymerization the propagating species in cationic polymerization >	723905.1701088207
< < < let us say it reaches up to here >	11765.510593980385
< < < if you notice here some of the experimental conditions amino acylase was immobilized by ionic binding to deae sephadex m concentration of substrate was used containing x m <unkn> salt which acts as stabilizing agents stabilizer for enzymes and reaction temperature was <unkn> c >	576636.9789184555
< < < a space velocity is analogous to dilution rate in the cstr and so you will notice here that the same enzyme was able to act on methionine as well as <unkn> >	14625.874965881787
< < < so what so we can write that k i is much higher than k p rate constant for the polymerization and rate of polymerization which is again the standard way of writing k p >	8929.508485473556
< < < so those entropies will not change >	40520.50032267984
< < < one is that the scientist wanted to apply some of the enzymes for industrial processing and obviously for industrial processing you need certain operational advantages the major disadvantages in the case of the enzymes is the restriction in the best mode of processing the stability some of the physico chemical properties in respect of ph optimum temperature optimum substrate specificity and they could all be taken care for industrial processing >	773597.7375686698
< < < one is the maximum reaction velocity which is v k e km k k k another point i like to make it clear here is vm is not a kinetic constant >	6200.482002853059
< < < so what is the value if i >	952.0447979201923
< < < so that is why this radical is very stable and that can be stored for days in a container which can be used later on >	3703.1087239805556
< < < the major limitation you also noticed during our understanding of the structure function relationship of the enzyme is that they are usually very unstable and that probably is one of the major limitations as far as enzymes are concerned with respect to their application >	6026.164405681809
< < < presence of crystallites helps in reducing the permeability of different gases >	4868038.050829575
< < < so actually you have the end to end distance between in a polymer coil is always changing so you have to get a time average end to end distance we introduced the term root mean square end to end distance which is given by this >	3407.6609540424224
< < < of the two major modifications of that which have been proposed and have been used in the enzyme catalyzed reaction one is a hollow fiber reactor >	5746.874659309156
< < < this is in the case of spherical particles >	844.3027349328606
< < < so we call this as a <unkn> >	11.458031814521421
< < < there could be inorganic lights stabilizer or photo stabilizer as well for example carbon <unkn> and they have particle size from to nano <unkn> and they are very effective <unkn> but obviously they can be all be used in samples which are meant to be black >	848822.917347822
< < < then you have the last configuration in which enzyme is modified by chemical modification so as to be made soluble in the non aqueous phase >	2018.2214487545086
< < < so to get an average or to improve properties so what we will do >	23591.722850626546
< < < for example if you have carboxylic acid like acrylic acid and then compare its copolymerization behavior over <unkn> amide then we change in ph of the medium >	247731.49559703856
< < < but the technical details of methodology for immobilization remain the same as in the case of enzymes >	12971.36944997239
< < < now by this you may not have to remember all this approach unless you are extremely interested to know the logic behind to get the final expression >	99166.6126002305
< < < so at degree or beyond degree you cannot at all polymerize alpha methyl styrene >	55022.131202149896
< < < for the first time he carried out reactions under controlled ph >	116441.10552973657
< < < so it <unkn> more and the transparency is transparency is very less in fact this is opaque >	293535.17291561514
< < < so this type of model d lattice model is quite justifiable >	41351.89335150948
< < < but in case of step of polymerization we are talking about number of molecular present that means each one each molecules whether it is a monomer or dimmer or trimmer that also are in those are also <unkn> part of polymer polymer sample >	162237.15231604752
< < < this is ki the dissociation constant for the inhibitor >	2927.766503552969
< < < in today s lecture we are going to discuss about amorphous and crystalline states of polymers >	358.2502408287015
< < < we will discuss that and on the other hand the second method is microencapsulation where you tend to form a kind of a artificial cell with its boundary of a semi permeable membrane and the enzyme molecules are entrapped within this membrane and these micro <unkn> can be used as the immobilized enzyme preparations >	5997.193458284445
< < < there is no continuous output or input in the system and the conversion is given by the rate of reaction >	811.6074951078268
< < < unless applications emerge one will not like to produce them in large quantities >	78778.46845607457
< < < the high performance polymers are having the highest performance and so does the price >	111194.96543457008
< < < let us just go back to earlier page and repeat this >	25050.70809600917
< < < so the <unkn> is that in addition to the natural reactions catalyzed by enzymes there is always a range of non natural reactions that are of commercial interest >	1090.1793361798384
< < < now in this case the ionic species are the initiator or rather the initiators are ionic species so as the propagating species also ionic >	62607.37826654001
< < < so here again you can have if you have same configuration of this carbons then this is like this >	3040.4881397448817
< < < and you also know from our kinetics we the kinetics >	3977.383066747207
< < < in almost all cases of the immobilized preparation the storage stability has noted to be higher in terms of its half life >	213363.58686290632
< < < with a small stress you can strain the sample much more fibers is the extreme case >	382250.70504166756
< < < at the end you get a homo polymer of m >	370.7056450902177
< < < and or the fraction of the radicals which are produced by homiletic cleavage or the redox reaction of the initiator molecules they are not percent of those starts a chain polymerization or the initiate chain polymerization in part of which are get lost >	27877.394407571617
< < < they are <unkn> the maximum number but its weight reach matters most not the number in terms of polymer property is >	104290.10028084266
< < < so what we will do in the next lecture let us start from this page and look at the value of this c s transfer constant and is know the higher the value of c s the more the solvent participate in the transfer reaction so lower would be the molecular weight of the resulting polymer >	1937.4465632961421
< < < so k p is constant throughout this process >	6053.692694365364
< < < so you can actually combine these three strategies like using polar molecular polymer solvent like thf thf and do reaction in much lower temperature say like at minus degree centigrade and use bulky initiator >	561696.8103707145
< < < the analogy lies that the reactions that are catalyzed by the enzymes in a living cell if they are carried out in an industrial atmosphere with perfect <unkn> economical situation environmentally friendly conditions we have a good <unkn> in enzymes and that is again another basis of use of enzymes in the process industries and also the possibility of studying them in such a great detail >	98847.55825513856
< < < ligases join two molecules at the expense of energy source >	513910.50897429837
< < < so r i which is initiation rate for single particle will be total of initiator rate by the number of particles so i just putting this r i here to get this so you get the molecular weight as this >	290805.5284997669
< < < in the case of cstr voidage can be considered almost equal to one whether the volume occupied by the carrier is very very small compared to the total reactor volume >	2592.712576326432
< < < so if you plot the conversion we plot the conversion with time as more and more active micelle form or the polymerization takes place in more and micelle more and more my micelles >	55836.37355354674
< < < so therefore if particle size is reduced you get an advantage that the fraction of the total particle which is <unkn> the substrate increases coming to one when the particle size is too small and usually in most cases as per the experimental experiences that a particle size about thirty microns in most cases of the biochemical reactions has been considered to give you an effectiveness factor of one >	213264.11278319976
< < < when we talk of the immobilization for industrial reactors the major factor is the cost and in terms of the cost it is desirable that when we produce them on a commercial scale using microbial cells those enzymes which are intercellular in nature they could be used almost in the form of >	15190.20352048401
< < < similarly in this case the reactivity of this radical does not depend we are assuming that it does not depend on the size of the molecules >	565.0438152812641
< < < obviously the nmr spectra for the monomer will be different then it specially different than the polymers for example if you have vinyl any vinyl molecules >	23516.224672532357
< < < now once this is formed which is electron deficient what happened >	245.27716601204833
< < < now this and this is very close to the <unkn> of this change over >	247.92434410895592
< < < hexokinase phosphorylate hexose to a hexose phosphate through involvement of atp a very characteristic enzyme >	37517654.23683882
< < < what we will do now we will move to the next polymerization method which is a ring opening polymerization or in short r o p >	1251.9469298387828
< < < so that gives you another major advantage for using an immobilized preparation >	2293.5423546630127
< < < so p d i is plus p by >	1024.7049651797413
< < < the lower route is catalyzed one enzyme catalyzed >	1008876.6371052224
< < < now the drop in i is much <unkn> compared to drop in m concentration of m which means that x n the average degrees of polymerization or the molecular weight increases with time >	6962.491851257229
< < < so that it can be used for generating or radical polymerization is acquits medium as well whereas a i b n can be used in the radical polymerization in organic solvents so organic medium >	19449.358312784712
< < < now if you compare the other cases like r and r is >	504.98924628665617
< < < whenever we look into any method particularly the protein engineering methods we tend to increase the number of sulphydryl bridges >	15512.677548697548

< < < so we will deal we will discuss only about random coil not about the other two confirmations of polymer molecules >	181100.67368922953
< < < we can rearrange this expression and write like this which is just a mathematical rearrangement you can write this >	2423.8771869005145

< < < we will continue from these and talk about termination reactions or transfer reactions >	38403.33257130618
< < < so when we are considering rate of initiation we are only taking or only considering considering this k d not the k i >	271506.73845901375
< < < so if your molecular weight goes up then your critical temperature also will go down >	1972.4138930840838
< < < that means in the absence of water for hydrolysis which require water as a second substrate or for hydrolysis reaction water is the reactant >	90281.60838602233

< < < then another feature is the effect on the double reciprocal plot lineweaver burk plot and the nature of lineweaver burk plot which is influenced as a function of inhibitor concentration will also tell you about the class of a particular inhibitor >	8525.889494821553
< < < the <unkn> of active site on the surface of an enzyme molecule is brought about by tertiary folding of the enzyme protein >	311.273474801281

< < < i think you will also recall what we had seen earlier the diagram in which you have a thin film a stationary film around the particle >	91459.43694071259

< < < data on all these parameters must be provided to characterize the particular immobilized enzyme preparation >	388217.0958423012
< < < now what about this in a non solvent what about this the polymer solvent interaction parameter becomes but expansion factor you can now imagine or you can think cannot be less than because it is the unperturbed dimension if you are talking about a single chain >	9958.796156535911
< < < it has rigid plastics and also it finds several applications and there are lots of applications and in most of the applications are pvc plasticized >	52877.39331505184

< < < we have been discussing steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme reactors >	40.47534223997543
< < < so between t g and t m the semi crystalline polymer is composed of rigid crystallites like rigid crystallites which are composed which are dispersed in a rubbery amorphous matrix >	165933.6744630609
< < < crystalline domain exists in room temperature which actually gives this polymer the strength and this is a hard material >	373786.77601591585
< < < so this type of solvent dependent reactivity was absent in case of radical chain polymerization >	1427.3723205516849
< < < so generally reactions are down at ambient temperature or may be slightly higher than ambient temperature solvent is very important even more in case of anionic polymerization you can the solvents are mainly used is aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons >	321843.0326335198
< < < so if you plot delta m versus x you get the slope as delta mu minus delta mu and the intercept will be at x <unkn> to delta mu and at x is equal to we will get delta mu two till the intercepts intercept at x is equal to and x is equal to >	113426.51797420905
< < < so that you can get narrower and this is the most typical values of p d i you get from a normal polymerization radical polymerization reaction >	1027.7475105787419
< < < this initiates the polymerization >	1205840.3747843842

< < < the most commonly used method of cross linking the enzyme molecules is by the use of glutaraldehyde which possesses two aldehyde groups separated by a hydrocarbon chain the three ch groups >	15050.78244432629
< < < now let us talk about great <unkn> in case of polymers >	629.3346557917582
< < < so if you plot and this has been shown experimentally if i have this plot r p rate of polymerization with i to the power half square root of i it gives a straight line so as this >	29418.084984169785
< < < the reaction will continue propagation will continue till your free monomer concentration becomes as the equilibrium free monomer concentration >	99311.42658215488
< < < and as i said earlier this four is your the termination reactions >	4042.9848473830484

< < < unless if you do not use the additives in those resins which are coming out of the reactor they are will come down drastically >	16719.936946397265
< < < today with an understanding of the site directed <unkn> it is possible to change the substrate specificity and also improve the catalytic functional rates >	219636.21456668206
< < < if the reaction has to take place then they must start <unkn> with each other >	1932.8792063040914
< < < rate of termination reaction we know k t m dot square where m dot is the concentration of total radical total propagating radical >	2926.6369606178723
< < < all those cases variety of cases will come under the category of competitive inhibition and the purpose is that the presence of inhibitor must reduce because reversible inhibition depends on the concentrations of the two species inhibitor and substrate and they will affect the binding mechanism >	19635.40378172349
< < < so you can consider these reactions of this with isobutylene and you get propagating chain like this which can again react with alkyl halide >	206944.483934426
< < < now in this slide it is shown as one of the d version of the d >	6845.000240689727
< < < and there the could be deformation in case of semi crystalline polymer could be deformation in in the amorphous region or in case of <unkn> light region >	35201.56132375283
< < < now we will know whether the polymer what is the polymers we have made so in this chemical structure analysis we will be basically discussing mainly this spectroscopic techniques by which we will be analyzing the chemical structures including the microstructures of polymer molecules >	33138.36088032788
< < < i have listed some of them here >	27653.251308550032
< < < so now this can be we can put this value of r p here so we can get k p m by twice k t r p at steady state so if you know tau s we know k p by r p >	6609.255382152658

< < < these are cotton placed in the container below >	500824.07525904174
< < < so the main degradation happened by <unkn> as shown in this figures >	59173.9202070273
< < < so you can remain maintain all the advantages of the high polymer bulk polymerization and you can get the polymers by filtration as a beads >	44832.17557058156
< < < so these are typical anionic surfactant used in this emulsion polymerization process and typical concentration of are the ratio of water is to monomer is taken as say about to by weight >	485338.950739334
< < < the answer is no because in this case we have only considered the forward reaction we are talking about propagation reaction whereas there could be backward reaction depropagation reaction as well >	9160.380424982297
< < < so give let us give some examples of this transfer reaction when x a is initiator say i have a reaction of acrylonitrile >	51076.3220826586

< < < it is not due to its magnitude its value of del h polymerization >	62336.92526651998

< < < a large number of examples which you may be familiar with are what we call as group specific enzymes >	594.0486361055443

< < < and this is we talking a continue our discussion on radical copolymerization so it is applicable for radical copolymerization >	4225.179194702845
< < < if the enzyme loading is constant then the tau will also have the similar ratio because in our reactor performance equation the left hand side is ke >	23808.121426355534
< < < say if you are your trying to polymerize a monomer and then at the end you are not able to get the h high enough molecular weight which you planned from your experiment >	6404.205599896579
< < < for example if you require a very stringent ph control or a temperature control or addition of a secondary substrate at a different period other than the beginning of the reaction then batch reactor provides you operational convenience a better term would be the use of batch reactor is based on certain operational <unkn> >	172945.51537307422
< < < today in the literature we will find probably a few thousand methods of immobilization and not that all of them have been commercially viable because commercially <unkn> is an issue which is linked directly to economics the power of economics >	365357.7964071923
< < < one of the disadvantages here is the stability of this material >	5598.048605187051
< < < so the molecular of repeat unit is the average of the structure units minus the conducted which had gone out in this case water molecules because of the condensation reaction >	11901.36247962242
< < < so see intensity of the scattered light actually becomes also proportional in addition to it become depend up on the molar mass concentration and d n by d c square it also depends up on the p theta which we call the form factor or angular scattering factor >	108866.26784973561

< < < initially if the ph <unkn> is mild if you go beyond a certain level of ph change you might observe only reversible change and therefore the enzyme can be brought back to a native confirmation but if you further change the ph it might undergo to a irreversible inactivation and which may not be possible to bring back >	499114.56883093156
< < < linked means what i mean that basically the polymers are exposed or be in contact with heat or some environment conditions and then the properties mechanical properties of polymers are followed according after exposure >	1058831.540226008
< < < you can imagine that it is it is a d lattice >	15.754587110097129

< < < so with this we i stop this lecture and in the next lecture i will continue with this anionic chain polymerization >	360.9025257596405

< < < that is the plus point >	5539.14358027192
< < < this was anionic initiator if you have a cationic initiator for this case then if it has to react and form something like this >	5529.711199724335

< < < the second substrate has to interact with the binary complex before the first product can arrive at but the stable intermediates are only ea and ey >	214868.14010473446
< < < the question is how to analyze a practical situation >	36481.42270477724
< < < another major important factor is better integration with the chemical steps in synthetic sequence where you want to use enzyme as a part of a sequence of reactions in an organic chemical synthesis where the substrate is coming already dissolved in organic solvent you can always integrate enzymatic reaction in the sequence of steps >	78463.32310284965
< < < their ionization doesn t really influence each other so much >	2327619.599804685
< < < you will notice that the reactor productivity also is linked with the fractional conversion >	328.25740639243304
< < < now you know del g is del h minus t del s >	3310.9570926219044

< < < now you also know from basic physical chemistry knowledge that rate constant can be expressed in form of arrhenius type equation expression where you can write rate constant is a e to the power minus e by rt where k is rate constant a is the frequency factor frequency <unkn> factor e is the activation energy for the reaction >	35449.74931131516

< < < but in general you will notice that in the case of substrate dependent thermal deactivation the performance of pfr will be superior compared to a cstr >	805.238538843753
< < < and what are the mechanism and what are the problem in interfacial polymerization >	4012.147297856301
< < < this gradient it might so happen that it comes down to zero >	24006.432723690355

< < < g rt ln km >	18.154460737115173
< < < now this anionic species or cationic species they are not present alone in the medium they are always associated with or <unkn> by a counter ion >	57886.86067585086
< < < so what happen slowly this micelle core will become something like this is larger so after some time you have this is say polymer particle and this concern polymer particle and free monomer and your surfactant micelle grows in size >	1102202.0381840079
< < < assuming that they are close to is to one or whatever target molecular rate you are looking for that has to be the same what you are giving >	33422.02128816047
< < < they all follow a combination of these mechanisms and the contributions made by each of these mechanisms will vary from enzyme to enzyme and if more than one mechanism is employed to reduce the energy of activation the enzyme will be able to perform better catalysis in a more efficient way >	45592.43904030322
< < < so it is it is very very useful to application like film where you can cover a part of the film and you can keep part of the film <unkn> where if you sign light that part will get polymerized leaving the part where which is covered as <unkn> medium >	73883.21863660976

< < < if they are in terminated by a coupling reaction then you have twice nu is the molecular weight average molecular average degrees of polymerization whereas if they are terminated by <unkn> reactions then the average degrees of polymerization would be equals to the kinetic chain length nu >	4431.532349858925
< < < so you can write k e s will be the initial rate of reaction >	377.1323084818341
< < < so freely rotating chain we can get this expression >	4599.946141604396
< < < so a polymer can have amorphous material >	2658.6997706288635
< < < so what it essentially means >	48129.91555767197
< < < that means the fluid dynamics in the reactor whether it is a back mix system or its a plug flow system does not influence the reactor performance as long as the reaction is in the zero order regime or the concentration of the substrate is much much higher than the km value and you must appreciate that if it is in our limits we will always like to use a very high substrate concentration >	447.88224994175596
< < < l c s t can be observed for this two cases as well where we have psi parameter negative another polymer is <unkn> you can have l c s t because you have a strong interaction between the polymer and the solvent >	51909.90046506335

< < < so to achieve that the recycle time must be very small or the recycling has to be very fast and therefore these two kinds of reactor systems are very commonly used as batch reactor >	5840.307533671146
< < < they are not taking part in the reshuffling reactions which means the nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of this group >	129.1619789724345
< < < you do not need any calibration >	9.394165566321202
< < < now let us talk about we will not spend too much time on the effect of the pressure on the rate of polymerization and molecular weight because it is not very significant as i said >	1355.220906074251
< < < the enzyme feed is put in in the hollow fibers and the main feed substrate is passed through the cell side and because of the semi permeability of the hollow fiber membranes the substrate and the enzyme can come in contact >	87845.84517104836
< < < so this the name as the name suggest we take <unkn> of a matrix to <unkn> by help of a laser radiation and in the vaporized states the polymers gets dissolved from the matrix and then get ionized >	71423.90560304538
< < < how much should i take because if we take too much excess then ultimately you will not land up in the target molecular weight you know the molecular weights will be very could be very low >	49331.7074966222
< < < so in this case the enthalpy of crystallization is not taken in to account >	14232.724956592054
< < < so that is the expression which relates the number of average molecular weight with r which is ratio of the moles of two bi functional monomers present in the system at the beginning where r is defined such a way that it is always less than equals to and p is the conversion which is defined as the fraction of the functional groups which is present in a smaller quantity as reacted >	1648.9794834188865

< < < having looked into a variety of immobilization methods we should also have a code to characterize an immobilized enzyme preparation by any method >	63320.99977777511

< < < here you can make modification if you transfer the reaction velocity in the volumetric form like for example <unkn> <unkn> these are the two rate constants zero order or first order based on volumetric and surface area and in that case for a cylindrical pore the k will be equal to k <unkn> v ks r therefore one can write here as ds dx v as the basic second order differential equation a solution of which can give you if you substitute the reaction rate term here depending on the nature of the reaction either by assuming a first order kinetics or zero order kinetics or even michaelis menten kinetics and michaelis menten kinetics will require a numerical solution and analytical solution may be difficult and you can get the solution of the substrate concentration as a function of the distance x from the surface >	47413.03396902342

< < < so conversion is percent and what is the degree of polymerization is degree of polymerization is the number of structural unit present in the polymer chain or polymer molecule >	120.77456274925943
< < < so here you first make a step polymers by step polymerization mechanism you make a unsaturated polyester and then by doing a chain reaction you can do a cross linking reaction to form a cross linking reaction >	2048.2817526422664
< < < as i mentioned you will always assume a mechanistic hypothesis to arrive at rate expression >	19870.037982646983
< < < that means usually the product stream after the batch processes will be <unkn> with an enzyme >	272725.2910602412

< < < one of the important things that we should recall is that these intermolecular cross linking requires certain very reactive reagents so that the functional groups of the enzyme can covalently bind under mild reaction conditions >	71440.7260557038

< < < you can talk about mechanical properties or optical properties like glass haze with in contact of the chemicals of the optical properties might change as well >	878824.8888918685
< < < so what happened in terms of <unkn> representation and this for a proton molecule this <unkn> are randomly oriented when there is no external magnetic field now in the absence of any external magnetic field these are randomly oriented >	60461.19080097279
< < < if it <unkn> any of the conditions it is synthesized by condensation reaction or it has a function group in the backbone or you can imagine that it has been synthesized from monomers by elimination of small molecules and if any of polymers which does not fulfill any of these criteria we classify that as addition polymers >	7644.631177386826

< < < even though the amount of the additives used are less but because of their higher cost compared to the base resin the cost of the polymer formulation would be higher >	12595.985498927668
< < < so most of the surfactant molecules present at in this water medium as micelles as you can appreciate that because the surfactant concentration is quite high and cmc of the surfactants are quite low >	78061.61203968085
< < < the way this model works is that you put the chain end at the origin of the d coordinate and found out what is the probability that the other chain end would be at distance of r from the origin say if you put this x y z then the probability of that the other end would be at point x y z which is having a distance r from the origin would be given by right >	6215.987901735811
< < < and so as this the hydro oxide group remember we talked about the equal reactivity of functional groups so we are considering all this functional group present at the end of a molecules are equal >	1635.4147825527166
< < < now this cationic chain polymerization can be utilized to synthesize telechelic polymers as well where telechelic term means low molecular weight typically less than k molecular weight with a functional group at end which can be utilized for further reaction >	59034.44662166065
< < < the next stage which is again very important is to look at the ionization of substrates because it is not only important that the enzyme may ionize it may also be very commonly feasible that when you are handling the charged substrate molecules and very often the protein itself is a substrate which is a poly electrolyte and it will have many functional groups which will be ionisable >	115513.45966194695
< < < so which actually gives you isotactic polymers and we write this as m m so meso pair and another meso pair >	424.8181420248092
< < < so total molecules at the beginning at t is equal to or n which is n is n a by number of aa molecules plus number of bb molecules n a bar r by which gives plus by r >	49556.579473242455
< < < as we also mentioned right in the beginning that any kinetic analysis will involve the match between the hypothesis the rate expression and the experimental data >	13467.249955949963
< < < the monomer <unkn> drops as well as the initiator concentration drop >	17266.453283862116
< < < just to mention these two features that this step growth polymers are reversible equilibrium reaction and having at a pet k value which depend on the reactivity and temperature >	1187617.6131005003
< < < so you can if you want to increase the polymerization rate you can do it much easier way by increasing the temperature >	1402.9199238867247
< < < now what is the comparison >	296.70441828821606
< < < so we are not writing t i t i >	7318.969482216667
< < < because the contact angle between the water and the polymeric surface is very high so it basically <unkn> off and giving the <unkn> of process it can take away that they are the impurities which are present in the surface >	37451.306325206104
< < < so basically electron density on the double bond if there s a electron donating group then the electronic density or the electrostatic charge will go up then q value will be going up >	144520.98662768086
< < < with increasing external energy external magnetic field the energy between the two state increases and with increasing in the difference between the two energy states the <unkn> is in the lower state which is ground state becomes more and more compared to the higher states >	65271.46938726318
< < < in this case you do not have those problems because you are doing in a solution then heat heat transfer can takes place efficiently because it is solution viscosity does not build up >	35295.183686162156

< < < if the e is the active form not the neutral enzyme in that case although >	85542.05248514209
< < < now to start the discussion on molecular weight we defined a term called kinetic chain length nu which is which is the number of monomers polymerized per each radicals that initiated the polymer chain >	949.1802388283552
< < < this two can react and form a <unkn> between two linear chains >	260.4440295380207
< < < part of the substrate which got protonated by binding with the hydrogen ions becomes a dead end complex as happened in the case of a competitive inhibitor and therefore you get a similar profile which gives you a km value >	5104.069061265982
< < < if you make a plot of this curve a semi logarithmic plot that means ln c c or ln c c verses time you will end up with a slope of q v and intercept of ln that is zero >	62979.27007240761
< < < you can also look at these expressions in a graphical mode and to have a better <unkn> >	10333.845560974589
< < < we must also look at the possible kind of interactions that are likely to take place and almost all the interactions between enzyme and substrate for bi substrate reactions have been classified into some general forms >	4251.691155305368

< < < for urea urease is the enzyme ultra filtration membrane co two electrode an ion selective electrode >	376330.46911917994
< < < so this expression <unkn> us that v e decreases linearly with the polymer size goes up v will go down >	5587.473578059933
< < < so basically m will have a much higher tendency to more polymerize whereas m has little tendency to move polymerize >	33471.19511740788
< < < you can also conclude that the faster reactions will have a smaller value of e >	4625.735004400134
< < < so look at the number again benzene cyclohexane toluene if you increase go toluene to ethyl benzene isopropyl benzene the tendency of transfer reaction goes up >	74124.99947916882
< < < when you increase fractional conversion the productivity will go down and for the first order regime the productivity of pfr will be much much higher than the cstr >	1381.989510054366
< < < so entropy of the polymerization is combination of propagation initiation as well as termination >	89524.72545203492
< < < so again on average we have chains or moles of chains with nu degrees of polymerization into nu divided total number of chains is >	33591.0513358438
< < < so once we get the enthalpy of mixing we have to get the gibbs free energy of mixing and once we get the final expression of the gibbs free energy mixing then we will look at the <unkn> of the flory huggins theory and what are the limitations or <unkn> in the flory huggins theory and then try to apply this flory huggins theory in the dilute polymer solutions and get the concept of theta temperature >	3377.353370840317
< < < a very accurate method which also has many other <unkn> is in terms of lack of interference >	136493.90225594232
< < < so all these systems will be considered in the format of immobilized enzyme preparation and the enzyme preparation may be in the coupled form in the insoluble matrix it could be entrapped into a semi permeable cell or entrapped in the gel because gel also provides you a porous network in which the enzyme can be entrapped and they will not be allowed to pass out through the gel pores because of the size limitation once they are entrapped and a similar thing applies to a ultra filtration reaction >	271247.97198585415
< < < so basically the polymers we deal in the lab sometimes we do not require detectors of so many angles may be one detectors at low angles could be sufficient for determination of the molecular weight >	173454.81597177353
< < < if you look at product inhibition product inhibition also has influence in two modes >	324880.34463125904

< < < gel formation means which is not soluble in the medium which is insoluble in any solvent all in bulk as well >	401327.3296943263
< < < you lead into a heterogeneous catalysis and the various species that are involved in the reaction it could be a substrate it could be inhibitor it could be simple hydrogen ions which contribute to the ph they might get <unkn> in the two phases depending on the chemical nature of the bulk and the carrier particles and this partition effect can also lead to an apparent loss of enzyme activity in a particular situation >	10188.258665514748

< < < you talk about amide you have this >	42748.79004548551
< < < so if you talking about copolymerization the values r will change with the different types of initiators medium polarity and temperature >	41646.768582153265

< < < now you can also argue that as the reaction progresses the monomer the monomer concentration in this case monomer means the species which is forming the cyclic that also comes down because you know the time goes the monomer molecule react >	33712.310405047254

< < < so this is simplified it can be very simplified if we imagine that rates of all this reactions are same >	168011.19796376865
< < < now in this case in a polymer there are hardly any differences between say first two group or atom in this two case >	101523.87516784675

< < < this is an example not really of a metabolite or some kind of a substrate or the product but it was just like an environmental analysis where the presence of certain cholinesterase inhibitors present in either <unkn> or <unkn> as a result of <unkn> were monitored continuously using an immobilized cholinesterase entrapped in a starch matrix plus a <unkn> spectrophotometer because the product ultimately gives a <unkn> and the change in <unkn> as a result of inhibitor present >	147220.1754869847
< < < it will be part of it or trace of which will be remaining >	7495.503835226774
< < < if you make a mass balance across this differential element at steady state you see the output of the substrate will be prd ds dx out >	3574.0126870008153
< < < so often we need catalyst to make the reaction feasible >	15951.716764805025
< < < so it will try to find space to go now it can go inside micelle or it can go the monomer droplets because that is the place where you have hydrophobic environment >	40798.00337278243
< < < after the gel is formed then you can subject it to butyraldehyde to provide crosslinking and therefore get a permanently insoluble gel preparation >	354639.62898963643
< < < so solvated has three solvated ion pair or loose ion pair or they can be totally free free ion pair >	474746.1079694931
< < < and generally this small organic additives they <unkn> by <unkn> <unkn> mechanism by meaning by terms <unkn> mechanism meaning that they do destroy themselves and protect the polymer the main polymer which you want to maintain or retain >	640747.143686394
< < < it immediately brings in a conformational change on the second binding site whereby the dissociation constant reduces to a ks >	142313.91859733316

< < < they are depending upon the extent of crystalline and they can become translucent or opaque as well >	224998.14054276966
< < < now let us consider first a single bond the simple bond one bond if you one bond like this now the other one in case of freely rotating in case of freely rotating chain you can place it here you can place it here or even you can place it here >	421327.3003614642
< < < and if you do not want the polymers in bead shape you want the polymer as such in a powder shape or shape whatever and then because the polymers are formed in beads bead form it is very sometimes it becomes very difficult if you want to isolate the polymers in the form other than beads >	77608.77636543916
< < < now let us first understand why we need to add additives in polymers >	18116.468132914117
< < < so which means if we increase the polarity of the bonds more will be the intermolecular attraction t g will go up >	2718.4674410973125

< < < let us go and try to derive that >	8144.47983796125
< < < so let us stop for this lecture and i will start the discussion of polymer additive in the next lecture >	199.12653748025284
< < < it can even also be used along with like your fiber entrapped enzymes if the fibers are <unkn> in the form of a <unkn> or thing like that so that you get a very large surface area in the form of a film long film >	13516.283214640183
< < < so that is the fundamental one fundamental difference between chain polymers and step polymers how do we calculate or how do you understand what the average degrees of polymerization is or the average molecular weight average number average molecular weight is >	3081.9171962804794
< < < so these arrangements are <unkn> >	121844.87158338429
< < < so basically a good fire retardant polymer should not generate lots of smoke and <unkn> they should not produce toxic gases >	281530.9204730745
< < < other properties do not changes in molecular that much though it also increases with molecular weight but it does not keeps on increasing even if it slightly with molecular weight the other polymer will study it at a high molecular weight >	171168.5557952965
< < < let us consider in the second step all these dimers reacted with each other forming tetramer >	112180.08873046504
< < < you see that when you increase the substrate concentration the weightage to s concentration is so low that ultimately you end up in a scattering a <unkn> of data near the origin and therefore getting the <unkn> value of km and vm often tends to be difficult even after making a statistical analysis >	162482.25058813053
< < < we applied simple model of terminal model where we basically we are talking about how the composition of copolymer can be predicted from the reaction reactivity monomer reactivity ratios >	258780.70675408858
< < < and you must know the interaction of the additives with the plastics what is the how they interact with plastics interacts with other additives as i said the multiple additives are used same times interaction with other additives are also be important >	180519.04806148616
< < < you need to place or you need to measurements at very low theta typically less than degree >	63146.753787351496
< < < now you can have substituted butadiene as well >	14588.813589463745
< < < or in other words all the radicals which are getting generated by homiletic cleavage of this benzyl peroxide they are not participating or they are not initiating a chain which means that is the they are getting lost in doing non polymerization reaction >	37254.48256020727
< < < most cases you get from petroleum resources ultimately from a crude oil or in some cases you also get a monomers from <unkn> resources or bio resources >	138235.78826167696
< < < so that is that is good >	210.89143829017684
< < < the f fraction is getting <unkn> or <unkn> from the mixing pattern and therefore one is <unkn> >	38795.41191096443
< < < the two factors on which the classification of enzyme reactors can be based are on the mode of <unkn> and <unkn> of substrate and product stream and also physical configuration >	36017.24476303371
< < < whereas when the block length is small then they also scatter but the size because of the size is so small their scattering amount is low so this block copolymer the polymer material made out of this block copolymer will look transparent but slightly hazy >	1489632.2287743485
< < < this is the dissociation constant ki classical km and k >	1852.3806008110532
< < < in most cases they are specific interaction between polymer and solvent molecule is different than the interaction between a solvent solvent molecule or a polymer polymer molecules >	1673.2227053925135
< < < again like the various classification ways you know various ways of classifying polymer molecules this <unkn> so also not very <unkn> >	183323.6196970859
< < < so as i expected with increasing p you have x also increases molecular poly molecular also increases but if you plot with fraction you can see this is not the monomer features >	228446.06833796913
< < < during use the whole matrix is under certain hydrodynamic condition and which might cause the degradation of the carrier >	451339.76392953924
< < < now given this two structure now the fact that this monomer which is reacting with this reactant species which means that whether this is radical or cat ion or anion will get stabilized by the substitution y present >	194544.5646248241
< < < so if you consider this case the reaction happens like this >	761.6011911970774
< < < in case of chain polymerization you had situation like this where you can achieve the high molecular weight at the beginning and the time goes or the more or monomer get converted monomer get reacted you get the amount of high molecular weight polymers more and more with time >	4792.783428867663
< < < now polymer also show optical activity if they are a optically active conformation >	176703.38766534143
< < < to avoid this <unkn> of the radical propagating radical by which it will stop the reaction and also reduce the molecular weight >	781.9012412738717
< < < there is point to consider reaction kinetics you design your reactor system based on mass transfer diffusional requirements >	350925.9885147668
< < < there may be another possibility where on this high energy radiation is can capture a electron and form a radical anion and these radical anion can dissociate into a radical anion and which again gives away electron to form a radical >	352744.9876949366
< < < now reasons for <unkn> as we quickly as we have just mention this improvement with for the base polymer develop in broad property range of material dilute or high cost engineering resins and so on >	3690091.789999566
< < < so by <unkn> you get t c and so you can write at that point at t c both are zero this way you can get this >	34258.147682792856
< < < so higher the stability higher is the reactivity >	25745.198094505984
< < < when we have to use them in water soluble form it only means that the process has to be in the batch mode >	3872.279817265525
< < < so remember we talked about in step polymerization that the reactivity of the functional group present at the end of the oligomeric chain or a polymeric chain does not depends on what is present in the other side whether the other group is reacted or what is the length the oligomer >	1246.7194982945045
< < < if you take logarithm on both sides <unkn> log vmtrue log k h if you consider the extreme conditions that is when hydrogen ion concentration is much much greater than the ionization constant or in the other words the ph is smaller than pk then log vm log vmtrue >	10732.577887893774
< < < so under those conditions and assuming s equal <unkn> and epsilon of the erel in the case of first order regime at is >	178359.32627905157
< < < and you know less number of monomers can be polymerized <unkn> and there are even lesser number polymers which can be polymerized by both anionic and cationic polymerization >	6770.03854260734
< < < so similarly you can name other step growth polymers as well where you have to first <unkn> the functional group or the class in which they belong and then accordingly you name the polymer >	85895.1835760802
< < < it can also give you lot of insight into the biological phenomena the kind of reactions that the enzymes carry out inside the cell at molecular level their intercellular concentrations their <unkn> directions and regulation >	102053.42272836105
< < < but these are techniques and not used much nowadays these techniques are not used much for several reasons though mainly this techniques like osmotic membrane osmometry and vapor pressure osmometry are used and as we have discussed that they are complimentary to each other where membrane osmometry can determine molecular weight number of molecular weight for little higher range and vapor pressure osmometry can be used for determining molecular rates of low molecular weights of lower range >	342177.7106986867
< < < we will just give brief introduction brief description of those test >	152394.61439293987
< < < we have not considered any of the mass transfer limitations or partitioning effect in the system and in the worst situation if you compare with the two major types of reactor systems continuous flow reactor system cstr and pfr we can analyze the reactor performance for a given reaction on the basis of the relative concentration of substrate to the km value of the reaction >	2575.5840901468764
< < < now why do we need to control a molecular weight of a step polymer >	92.83771696856867
< < < for invisible blend it does not matter that you know that t g is for the homopolymers obviously then you can know you will know the t gs for the block co polymer immiscible block co polymer or invisible blends >	58262.16852655249
< < < it would be from this end to this end this would have been the end to end distance >	5397.400876685036
< < < so the contour length would be multiplied this by the number of bonds >	16866.65847350737
< < < h so those which have slightly higher >	2308701.6172966235
< < < if i have say like a a plus b f type it can undergo cross linking you can visualize yourself plus a f plus few b b molecule then also it can cross link from cross link or you can have if you have a f plus b f molecule this all this can form cross links cross linking >	374451.0936923367

< < < we we applied the steady state approximation to to find out the concentration of the radical total radical present >	42046.51591091449
< < < but the spiral wound module operates some where closer to only closer to plug flow behavior reactor and not exactly as a plug flow reactor >	862634.0747550529
< < < that means the rate of reaction is much slower than the rate of diffusion >	33.963199032492284

< < < now as we have been talking that this anionic polymerization proceeds without termination but that does not mean that this anionic chain ends leave <unkn> not there are some intrinsic self termination steps possible which are actually very slow and extremely slow >	166048.93342888306
< < < this course as you know deals with one of the <unkn> group of biomolecules what we know as enzymes >	115887.54193609521

< < < this is the most common way making block copolymer but we will not discuss this technique of synthesizing block copolymer in this section >	52805.241286124496
